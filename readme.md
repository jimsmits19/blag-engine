#blag-engine

a (really) lightweight blog engine.

Blog posts are just text files piped into a boilerplate html file. The title of the post is the first line of the file with some escaping and formatting to make it a valid file name. 

version 0.0.0: use express to serve html files generated from flat-files.
version 0.0.1: Adding ability to post a post to the server.
version 0.0.2: File names are handled.
